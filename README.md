# DelaySim

## Usage
- `objects_and_tools.py` defines emitters, receivers, and some tools.
- Follow the example in `compute_delay.py` to see how to do things like compute the time delay between two receivers for a given emitter location

## Coordinate systems
A quick note on coordinate systems
- This is a right-handed coordiante system
- Theta runs from 0 to 180, with 0 straight up (+z) and 180 straight down (-z)
- Phi runs from 0 to 360, with 0=+x, 90=+y, 180=-x, 270=-y
